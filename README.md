# Desert-Eagle
A simple 2D game written in C# and using monogame library, imitating the popular mobile game 'Flappy bird'. This is my first project in C#, and I created this game to practice C# and the use of monogame library.

A machine learning experiment based on this project can be found in the 'Project-Spearhead' repos.
