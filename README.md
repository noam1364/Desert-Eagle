# Desert-Eagle
A simple 2D game in C#, imitating the popular mobile game 'Flappy bird'. This is my first project in C#, and I created this game to practice C# and the use of monogame library.

A long time after I left the project, I started reaserching and experimenting with machine learning and genetic algorithms. Because of that, the game contains a few classes related to machine learning. they are not being used in this project, since I later continued the work in a different project (which is a clone of this one, but with the machine learning components), for simplicity, and so can change parts of the code and not worry about messing up the game.
